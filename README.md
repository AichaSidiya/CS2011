# CS2011
Data Structure and Algorithms

# Course Overview

This course provided a comprehensive understanding of various data structures commonly used in complex systems. Throughout the course, we explored the following data structures and applied them to solve a wide range of problems:

- Queue
- Stack
- Array-Based List
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Graphs

These data structures served as the foundation for implementing and solving different searching and sorting algorithms.

# Project Highlights

In addition, as part of our project, we solved multiple data structure problems on Hacker Rank.
